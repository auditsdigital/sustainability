## Positive impact of DAS on websites carbon footprint

The research study was conducted from July 1st to August 31st of 2020 with 55 independent tested websites that ran DAS (Digital Sustainability Audits) using the [web client](https://audits.digital) throughout the period.

The figure shows clearly how a considerable reduction on carbon footprint (carbonf: y-axis) is achieved as the DAS score (globalScore: x-axis) increases for a given website.
In fact, the maximum relative difference was of 70%, consisting of an effective reduction on carbon footprint of more than 10g of CO2eq (32 and 68 globalScore).
